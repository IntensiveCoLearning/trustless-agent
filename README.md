## Learning Materials/Course Schedule

**Module 1: The Trust Foundation — ERC-8004 Identity & Reputation Layer**

- In-depth analysis of the ERC-8004 standard: Identity Registry, Reputation Registry, and Verification Registry.
- Hands-on: Create an on-chain identity for your agent and implement a simple off-chain reputation feedback mechanism.

**Module 2: The Collaboration Language — A2A Architecture & AP2 Protocol**

- Master how agents autonomously discover and communicate via the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) architecture.
- Decode the AP2 protocol: Understand agent descriptor files, capability declarations, and interaction flows.
- Hands-on: Enable your agent to discover other agents and initiate collaboration requests.

**Module 3: The Value Engine — x402 Payment Protocol**

- Dissect how the x402 protocol utilizes the HTTP 402 status code to enable "gasless" micro-payments.
- Integrate EIP-3009 to achieve automated settlement for agent services and resource access control.
- Hands-on: Integrate x402 payment functionality into your agent service, enabling "pay-per-call".

**Module 4: Capstone Project — Building an Autonomous Agent**

- Integrate knowledge from the first three modules to build a full-lifecycle Trustless Agent.
- Implement the full automated workflow: from identity registration and reputation accumulation to autonomous collaboration and service settlement.
- Project Demo & Code Review: Receive direct feedback from the community and mentors.
