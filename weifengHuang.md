## Self-introduction

I’m a software engineer with a strong interest in Web3, AI, and automation. I’ve previously participated in AI-agent development, but haven’t yet explored integrating AI with Web3. Through this program, I hope to gain hands-on experience and collaborate on practical projects that bridge these two fields.
