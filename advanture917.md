## Self-introduction

I'm a senior student focusing on AI Agents and LLM toolchains, with experience in LangGraph and Python-based architectures. I'm exploring multi-agent collaborative and eager to learn how AI can integrate with blockchain through the Trustless Agents program while connecting with like-minded builders.
